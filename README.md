## SEG-Y file format

SEG-Y is a seismic data file format. Its name stands for the Society of Exploration Geophysicists Y format.
It is intended for data exchange and has become a standard for reflexion seismic processing.
The goal is for the SEG Technical Standard Commitee to uniformize the way we use and transfer seismic data.
Multiple revisions has been achieved to respect this whish:

- Revision 0 has first been published in 1975
- Revision 1 extended the standard to 3D acquisitions in 2002

SEG-Y was not meant to be a field record format at first, thus the SEG recommends to move to SEG-D or SEG-2 formats.
